## Basic terminology
* **File system** - The way files are stored and organized
* **Current directory** - The current directory that you are in
* **parent directory** - The current directory that you are in and have the options to move to another directory.
* **the difference between your home directory and the home directory** -Absolute path starts from the root and relative and relative path goes to the file that is in the current "directory"
* **pathname** -it indicates the location of the file in the filesystem
* **relative path** the location of a file starting from the current working directory 
* **absolute path** - the location of a file starting at the root of the file system
